# Xbox360RFArduino
Archive of Files from [electromaker.io](https://www.electromaker.io/project/view/xbox-360-rf-module-controlled-with-an-arduino-1?) with updated Wiring Diagram as the one on the site is extremely low resolution and incorrect.
The code says to use two diodes in series as the RF Module needs 3.3v and NOT 5v. I used some cheap step-down converters as shown in the Wiring Diagram that are just 1117 Voltage Regulators.

Anything can be used as long as the Module recieves it's 3.3v, DO NOT supply it with 5v.
