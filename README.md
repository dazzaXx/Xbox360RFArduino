With updated Wiring Diagram as the one on the site is extremely low resolution and incorrect.
The code says to use two diodes in series as the RF Module needs 3.3v and NOT 5v. I used some cheap step-down converters as shown in the Wiring Diagram that are just 1117 Voltage Regulators.

Anything can be used as long as the Module recieves it's 3.3v, DO NOT supply it with 5v.

All the files are not made by me in any shape or form, all the credits are in the original .ino file and is left untouched, I merely wanted to archive it all just in case, the only thing I made was the new Wiring Diagram.
